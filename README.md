Attaché is a deployment tool for Laravel originally based on the Laravel Envoy task runner and built around the ideas I wrote [here](https://medium.com/@warrickbayman/zero-downtime-laravel-deployments-with-envoy-version-2-227c8259e31c). The original version of Attaché was actually just a wrapper around Envoy with a predefind script (hence the name). It's evolved quite a bit since then.

Install Attache globally using Composer:

```
composer global require thepublicgood/attache
```

For usage instructions please see the [official documentation](https://tpg.github.io/attache/).
