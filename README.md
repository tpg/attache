# A Highly opinionated deployment tool for Laravel

![Test Suite](https://github.com/tpg/attache/workflows/Test%20Suite/badge.svg?branch=2.x)

Attaché is a deployment tool for Laravel originally based on the Laravel Envoy task runner and built around the ideas I wrote [here](https://medium.com/@warrickbayman/zero-downtime-laravel-deployments-with-envoy-version-2-227c8259e31c). The original version of Attaché was actually just a wrapper around Envoy with a predefind script (hence the name). It's evolved quite a bit since then.

> This branch is an attempt to rewrite parts of the Attaché code base in order to make it more testable, and add sone long missing features. The 0.7.* series will be maintained until complete feature parity has been reached.
