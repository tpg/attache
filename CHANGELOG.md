# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
### Changed
* The configuration requires the `server` config setting has been changed from an array of objects to an object of servers keyed by their names.
* The `name` server config attribute has been removed.

## [0.6.4] 13-07-2020
### Changed
* The `before-prep-composer` and `after-prep-composer` script hooks have been renamed to `before-prepcomposer` and `after-prepcomposer` respectively.

## [0.6.3] 13-07-2020
### Added
* Added two new script tags: `@root` points to the project root on the server. There is now a `@path` tag which takes one parameter. So `@path:releases` will give you the project releases path.
* The `deploy` command will now check if an installation is present. If not, it will fail and exit. An installation must be completed first.

## [0.6.2] 07-07-2020
### Fixed
* Fixed a bug in the script compiler that was not able to fetch the latest release ID since scripts are compiled BEFORE connecting to the server. The release ID is now passed into the compiler.

### Changed
* The `install` command will now attempt to create the project root directory with a `mkdir -p` command.

## [0.6.1] 25-06-2020
### Fixed
* Fixed a bug in the `init` command that wasn't locating the Git config correctly and wasn't setting the default remote URL.
* Fixed a bug in the `init` command that was not setting the Git remote correctly when more than one remote is configured.

## [0.6.0] 22-06-2020
### Changed
* Rewrote how tasks are executed locally. Attach√© should now throw an exception if one or more commands fail in the same way the SSH scripts work.

### Fixed
* Fixed a bug with the `releases:activate` command that was not creating the correct symlink.

## [0.5.3] 09-06-2020
### Added
* Added the ability to change the commands run during the build stage.

## [0.5.1] 31-05-2020
### Added
* Added a new `dev` setting to the Composer config.

### Changed
* Running SSH commands will now happen synchronously and will not return output until the entire task is complete. This should completely do away with the random errors received when getting the currrent releases list.
* Updates to the `install` command to make it just a little less error prone.

## [0.4.16] 19-05-2020
### Changed
* Rearranged the deployment steps a little to avoid a rare bug where the composer installation needed access to the `.env` config.
